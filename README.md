# FantasyMetroidvania

Made on Unity version 2022.3.46f1

A school project made with 7 other students which goal was to create a demo of a game focused on the elements.
Currently in the prototyping phase, this is a metroidvania where the player controls a knight able to use four elements to explore and fight with a twist, in which combat is done turn by turn instead of in real time.
